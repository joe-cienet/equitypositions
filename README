arrived, the positions would be REL= +50 and ITC= -40
 2.INSERT / UPDATE / CANCEL are actions on a Trade (with same trade id but different version)
 3.INSERT will always be 1st version of a Trade, CANCEL will always be last version of Trade.
 4.For UPDATE, SecurityCode or Quantity or Buy/Sell can change
 5.For CANCEL, any changes in SecurityCode or Quantity or Buy/Sell may change and should be ignored
 6.The transactions can arrive in any sequence
